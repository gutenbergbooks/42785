<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ROBERTSON'S "INDEX OF CHARTERS."</h3>

  <p>This work, so often quoted, is familiar to every antiquary; but as the
  name of the intelligent and laborious editor does not appear in any of
  our biographical dictionaries, a short sketch may not be unacceptable to
  our readers.</p>

  <p>William Robertson was born at Fordyce, in the county of Banff, in the
  year 1740. Having gone through the usual course of elementary instruction
  in reading and writing, he entered the Latin class at the grammar school
  of his native parish; a seminary then, as now, of great celebrity in the
  North of Scotland. Among his schoolfellows he contracted a particular
  intimacy with Mr. George Chalmers, afterwards Secretary of the Board of
  Trade; so well known by many elaborate and valuable commercial,
  historical, and biographical publications. The connexion between the
  schoolboys, originating in a similarity of taste and pursuits, was
  strengthened at a subsequent period of their lives by the contributions
  of the intelligent Deputy Keeper of the Records of Scotland to the local
  and historical information of the author of <i>Caledonia</i>, so
  honourably recorded in that national work. He completed his academical
  studies at King's College, Aberdeen, where he was particularly
  distinguished by his proficiency in the Greek language, under Professor
  Leslie. He was then apprenticed to Mr. Turner of Turnerhall, advocate in
  Aberdeen; but had been little more than a year in that situation, when
  Mr. Burnett of Monboddo applied to Professor Leslie to recommend to him
  as his second clerk a young man who had a competent knowledge of the
  Greek language, and properly qualified to aid him in his literary
  pursuits. The Professor immediately mentioned young Robertson; and Mr.
  Turner, in the most handsome manner, cancelled his articles of
  apprenticeship. During his connexion with Mr. Burnett, he accompanied him
  in several visits to France, on taking evidence as one of the counsel in
  the great Douglas cause. On his first visit there, he went with him to
  see the savage girl, who, at that time, was creating a great sensation in
  Paris; and, at his request, made a translation <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>of M. Condamines'
  account of her, to which Mr. Burnett wrote a preface. In the year 1766 he
  was appointed Chamberlain to James, Earl of Findlater and Seafield, on
  the recommendation of Lord Monboddo. In 1768 he published, at Edinburgh,
  <i>The History of Greece, from the Earliest Times till it became a Roman
  Province</i>, being a concise and particular account of the civil
  government, religion, literature, and military affairs of the states of
  Greece, for the use of seminaries of education, and the general reader,
  in 1 vol. 12mo. At this period, having caught a portion of the jealous
  nationality of the multitude, he published a political <i>jeu
  d'esprit</i> entitled <i>A North Briton Extraordinary</i>, by a young
  Scotsman in the Corsican service, 4to., 1769: designed to repel the
  illiberal invectives of Mr. Wilkes against the people of Scotland. Some
  of the popular objections to the Union reiterated by the young Scotsman
  having been found in the characteristic discussion between Lieutenant
  Lesmahagon and Matthew Bramble on the same subject, in <i>The Expedition
  of Humphrey Clinker</i>, the authorship was on that account erroneously
  attributed to Dr. Smollet, who had then discontinued an unsuccessful
  opposition to Mr. Wilkes in the <i>The Briton</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1773 Mr. Robertson married Miss Donald, only child of Captain
  Alexander Donald, of the 89th, or Gordon Highlanders. In the year 1777 he
  received his commission from Lord Frederick Campbell, the Lord Clerk
  Register of Scotland, as colleague of his brother, Mr. Alexander
  Robertson, who had been appointed one of the Deputy Keepers of the
  Records of Scotland some years before. He was now in a situation
  completely suited to his wishes, and entered on the duties of his office
  with the utmost enthusiasm. It very early occurred to him, that many
  ancient records of Scotland, which had been removed by Edward I., might
  still be recovered; and he suggested to Lord Frederick Campbell, who was
  as enthusiastic as himself in everything tending to throw light on the
  early history of Scotland, that searches ought to be made in the State
  Paper Office in London for the purpose of ascertaining whether some of
  the earlier records might yet be found. Lord Frederick Campbell entered
  warmly into his views, and the success with which the search was made may
  be ascertained by consulting the Preface to the <i>Index of
  Charters</i>.</p>

  <p>The Reports to the Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to inquire
  into the state of the records, with the suggestions made by him, and
  which have been so ably followed up since his death by the late Thomas
  Thomson, Esq., Deputy Clerk Register, were considered of such importance
  as to merit a vote of thanks of the Select Committee, which was
  transmitted to him along with a very friendly letter from Mr. Abbot, then
  Speaker of the House of Commons, afterwards Lord Colchester. He commenced
  the laborious work of printing <i>The Records of the Parliament of
  Scotland</i>, in which he made considerable progress, having, previous to
  his death, completed one very large folio volume.</p>

  <p>Between the years 1780 and 1790, in consequence of a strict
  investigation into the validity of the claims of several persons to
  peerages in Scotland, Mr. Robertson was much employed in inquiring into
  the state of the peerage, both by those who made and those who rejected
  such claims. This circumstance naturally led him to a minute acquaintance
  with the subject; and induced him to publish, in 1794, a quarto volume,
  entitled <i>Proceedings relative to the Peerage of Scotland from 16th
  January, 1707, to 20th April, 1788</i>: a work which has been found of
  the greatest service in conducting the elections of the representative
  peers of Scotland.</p>

  <p>In 1798, at the request of Lord Frederick Campbell, he published
  an&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Index, drawn up in the Year 1629, of many Records of Charters granted
  by the different Sovereigns of Scotland, between 1309 and 1413 (which had
  been discovered by Mr. Astle in the British Museum), most of which
  Records have been long missing; with an Introduction, giving a State,
  founded upon Authentic Documents still preserved, of the Ancient Records
  of Scotland, which were in that Kingdom in 1292."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The object of this publication was to endeavour to recover many
  ancient records, which there was much reason to believe were still in
  existence. The labour which he underwent in preparing this volume for the
  press, and in transcribing a very ancient quarto manuscript, written on
  vellum, which was found in the State Paper Office, was very great. Every
  word of this ancient vellum MS. he copied with his own hand, and it is
  printed along with the volume of the <i>Records of the Parliament of
  Scotland</i>. The preface, introduction, notes, and appendix to the
  <i>Index of Charters</i>, show, not only the great labour which this work
  required from him, but the extensive information also, on the subject of
  the ancient history of Scotland, which he possessed.</p>

  <p>At a general meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, held Jan. 28,
  1799, he was elected a member, and placed in the literary class of the
  Society. He died March 4, 1803, at his house, St. Andrew's Square,
  Edinburgh, in the sixty-third year of his age.</p>

<h3>COWPER, OR COOPER.</h3>

  <p>In the midsummer holidays of 1799, being on a visit to an old and
  opulent family of the name of Deverell, in Dereham, Norfolk, I was taken
  to the house of an ancient lady (a member of the aforesaid family), to
  pay my respects to her, and to drink <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>tea. Two visitors were
  <i>particularly</i> expected. They soon arrived. The first, if I remember
  rightly (for my whole attention was singularly riveted to the
  <i>second</i>), was a pleasant-looking, lively young man&mdash;very
  talkative and entertaining; his companion was above the middle height,
  broadly made, but not stout, and advanced in years. His countenance had a
  peculiar charm, that I could not resist. It alternately exhibited a deep
  sadness, a thoughtful repose, a fearful and an intellectual fire, that
  surprised and held me captive. His manner was embarrassed and reserved.
  He spoke but little. Yet <i>once</i> he was roused to animation; then his
  voice was full and clear. I have a faint recollection that I saw his face
  lighted up with a momentary smile. His hostess kindly welcomed him as
  "Mr. Cooper." After tea, we walked for a while in the garden. I kept
  close to his side, and once he addressed me as "My little master." I
  returned to school; but that variable, expressive, and interesting
  countenance I did not forget. In after years, standing, as was my wont,
  before the shop windows of the London booksellers (I have not
  <i>quite</i> left off this old habit!), reading the title-pages of tomes
  that I intensely longed, but had not then the money, to purchase, I
  recognised at a shop in St. Paul's Churchyard that well-remembered face,
  prefixed to a volume of poems, "written by William Cowper, of the Inner
  Temple, Esq." The <i>cap</i> (for when I saw "Mr. Cooper" he wore a wig,
  or his hair, for his age, was unusually luxuriant) was the only thing
  that puzzled me. To make "assurance doubly sure," I hastened to the house
  of a near relation hard by, and I soon learnt that "Mr. Cooper" was
  William Cowper. The welcome present of a few shillings put me in
  <i>immediate</i> possession of the coveted volumes. I will only just add,
  that I read, and re-read them; that the man whom, in my early boyhood, I
  had so mysteriously reverenced, in my youth I deeply and devotedly
  admired and loved! Many, many years have since passed away: but that
  reverence, that admiration, and that love have experienced neither
  diminution nor change.</p>

  <p>It was something, said Washington Irving, to have seen even the
  <i>dust</i> of Shakspeare. It is something too, good Mr. Editor, to have
  beheld the face and to have heard the voice of Cowper.</p>

<h3>YANKEE, ITS ORIGIN AND MEANING.</h3>

  <p>The meaning of the term <i>Yankee</i>, which our transatlantic
  brethren now willingly adopt as their collective name, has acquired more
  notoriety than it deserved from the unlucky and far-fetched derivations
  which it has received in so many different publications. The term is of
  Anglo-Saxon origin, and of home-growth. We all know, from the veritable
  Diedricht Knickerbocker's <i>History of New York</i>, that its earliest
  settlers were exclusively Dutchmen, who naturally named it, though from
  anything but similarity in local situation, New Amsterdam. We may, of
  course, suppose that in the multitude of these Dutch settlers the names
  they carried over would be pretty nearly in the same proportion as at
  home. Both then and now the Dutch <i>Jan</i> (the <i>a</i> sounded very
  broad and long), abbreviated from the German <i>Johann</i>, our
  <i>John</i>, was the prevailing Christian appellative; and it even
  furnished, in <i>Jansen</i>, &amp;c. (like our <i>Johnson</i>), frequent
  patronymics, particularly with the favourite diminutive <i>cke</i>,
  <i>Jancke</i>: and so common does it still remain as such, that it would
  be difficult to open the Directory of any decent-sized Dutch or Northern
  German town without finding numerous instances, as <i>Jancke</i>,
  <i>Jaancke</i>, <i>Jahncke</i>, &amp;c., according as custom has settled
  the orthography in each family. It is scarcely necessary to say that the
  soft <i>J</i> is frequently rendered by <i>Y</i> in our English reading
  and speaking foreign words (as the Scandinavian and German <i>Jule</i>
  becomes our <i>Yule</i>), to show how easily and naturally the above
  names were transformed into <i>Yahnkee</i>. So much for the name as an
  appellative; now for its appropriation as a generic. The prominent names
  of individuals are frequently seized upon by the vulgar as a designation
  of the people or party in which it most prevails. We have <i>Paddies</i>
  for Irishmen, <i>Taffies</i> for Welshmen, and <i>Sawnies</i>
  (abbreviated <i>Alexander</i>) for our Scotch brethren: so, therefore,
  when English interests gained the upper hand, and the name of <i>New
  Amsterdam</i> succumbed to that of <i>New York</i>, the fresh comers, the
  English settlers, seized upon the most prominent name by which to
  designate its former masters, which extended to the whole of North
  America, as far as Canada: and the addition of <i>doodle</i>, twin
  brother to <i>noodle</i>, was intended to mark more strongly the contempt
  and mockery by the dominant party; just as a <i>Sawney</i> is, in most of
  the northern counties, a term next door to a fool. It is, however, to the
  credit of our transatlantic brethren, and the best sign of their
  practical good sense, that they have turned the tables on the innuendo,
  and by adopting, carried the term into repute by sheer resolution and
  determinate perseverance.</p>

  <p>The term <i>slave</i> is only the misappropriation, by malevolent
  neighbours, of the Slavonic term <i>slaus</i> or <i>laus</i>, so frequent
  in the proper names of that people; <i>Ladislaus</i>, <i>Stanislaus</i>,
  <i>Wratislaus</i>, &amp;c., meaning, in their vernacular tongue, glory or
  praise, like the Latin <i>laus</i>, with which it is no doubt cognate:
  and so <i>servi</i> and <i>servants</i> is but a derivative from the
  <i>Serbs</i>, <i>Sorbs</i>, or <i>Servians</i>, whose glorious feats in
  arms against their Turkish oppressors have proved that there is nothing
  <i>servile</i> in their character.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S BEDSIDE, OR THE DOCTORS ENUMERATED.&mdash;A NEW BALLAD.</h3>

  <p>On looking over a collection of MSS. which has lain untouched for many
  years, I have lighted on the accompanying ballad. Of its source I know
  nothing; nor do I recollect how it fell into my hands. I have never seen
  it in print. The author, fancifully enough, imagines the various editions
  of Shakspeare brought in succession to the sick-bed of the immortal bard,
  and has curiously detailed the result of their several prescriptions.</p>

  <p>If you do me the favour of giving it insertion in your valuable "N.
  &amp; Q." I shall feel obliged; and I think that your numerous Shakspeare
  correspondents, to some of whom it may be unknown, will not be displeased
  at seeing it in the columns of your interesting journal. The editorial
  period to which the ballad is brought down will tolerably fix its
  date:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Old Shakspeare was sick&mdash;for a doctor he sent&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i1">But 'twas long before any one came;</p>
      <p>Yet at length his assistance Nic Row did present;</p>
      <p class="i1">Sure all men have heard of his name.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>As he found that the poet had tumbled his bed;</p>
      <p class="i1">He smooth'd it as well as he could;</p>
      <p>He gave him an anodyne, comb'd out his head,</p>
      <p class="i1">But did his complaint little good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Doctor Pope to incision at once did proceed,</p>
      <p class="i1">And the Bard for the simples he cut;</p>
      <p>For his regular practice was always to bleed,</p>
      <p class="i1">Ere the fees in his pocket he put.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Next Theobald advanced, who at best was a quack,</p>
      <p class="i1">And dealt but in old women's stuff;</p>
      <p>Yet he caused the physician of Twick'nam to pack,</p>
      <p class="i1">And the patient grew cheerful enough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Next Hanmer, who fees ne'er descended to crave,</p>
      <p class="i1">In gloves lily-white did advance;</p>
      <p>To the Poet the gentlest of purges he gave,</p>
      <p class="i1">And, for exercise, taught him to dance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>One Warburton, then, tho' allied to the Church,</p>
      <p class="i1">Produced his alterative stores;</p>
      <p>But his med'cines the case so oft left in the lurch</p>
      <p class="i1">That Edwards<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> kick'd him out of doors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Next Johnson arrived to the patient's relief,</p>
      <p class="i1">And ten years he had him in hand;</p>
      <p>But, tired of his task, 'tis the gen'ral belief,</p>
      <p class="i1">He left him before he could stand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Now Capel drew near, not a Quaker more prim,</p>
      <p class="i1">And number'd each hair in his pate;</p>
      <p>By styptics, call'd stops, he contracted each limb,</p>
      <p class="i1">And crippled for ever his gait.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>From Gopsal then strutted a formal old goose,</p>
      <p class="i1">And he'd cure him by inches, he swore;</p>
      <p>But when the poor Poet had taken one dose,</p>
      <p class="i1">He vow'd he would swallow no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>But Johnson, determined to save him or kill,</p>
      <p class="i1">A second prescription display'd;</p>
      <p>And, that none might find fault with his drop or his pill,</p>
      <p class="i1">Fresh doctors he call'd to his aid.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>First, Steevens came loaded with black-letter books,</p>
      <p class="i1">Of fame more desirous than pelf;</p>
      <p>Such reading, observers might read in his looks,</p>
      <p class="i1">As no one e'er read but himself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Then Warner, by Plautus and Glossary known,</p>
      <p class="i1">And Hawkins, historian of sound<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>;</p>
      <p>Then Warton and Collins together came on,</p>
      <p class="i1">For Greek and potatoes renown'd.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>With songs on his pontificalibus pinn'd,</p>
      <p class="i1">Next, Percy the Great did appear;</p>
      <p>And Farmer, who twice in a pamphlet had sinn'd,</p>
      <p class="i1">Brought up the empirical rear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The cooks the more num'rous the worse is the broth,"</p>
      <p class="i1">Says a proverb I well can believe;</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Cures for the Hooping Cough (Rubus fruticosus).</i>&mdash;The
  following is said to prevail in the counties of Warwick, Worcester, and
  Stafford, as a remedy for this harrowing disorder in children: that if a
  child is put to walk beneath a common bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>),
  having rooted in the ground at both extremities (which may be very
  commonly met with where they grow luxuriantly), a certain number of
  times, a perfect cure would be the result.</p>

<p><!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

  <p><i>Gryphea incurva.</i>&mdash;In the course of conversation with an
  old man in the county of Warwick, relative to ancient customs, he related
  to me as a fact within his own knowledge, that the pretty round stone
  shell, as he termed it (picking one up at the same time), a specimen of
  the <i>Gryphea incurva</i>, or Devil's Thumb, as it is frequently called,
  which is found in considerable quantities in the gravel beds of that
  county, when prepared in a certain manner&mdash;calcined, I
  believe&mdash;is a certain specific for this complaint in its most
  obstinate form. Indeed, he related to me some very extraordinary cures
  which he had himself witnessed.</p>

  <p><i>Donkey.</i>&mdash;A certain number of hairs taken from the black
  cross on the shoulders of a donkey, and put into a small bag made of
  black silk, and worn round a child's neck afflicted with the complaint,
  is a never-failing remedy.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Whimsical Bequest.</span>&mdash;On Saturday last, the
  unmarried of whatever age and sex, numbering between 800 and 900

  yore, under the following singular circumstances:&mdash;Many years ago, a
  piece of waste land, called 'Knave's Acre,' in the parish of St.
  Leonard's, was used as a playground by the boys of this and the adjacent
  parish of St. Mary Magdalen; but one day, the young gentlemen falling
  out, the affair ended in a regular 'fight;' and the result was that the
  boys of St. Leonard's vanquished their opponents, and ever after remained
  victors of the field. The ground was subsequently let for gardening
  purposes; but the owner, in perpetual remembrance of the juvenile
  victory, whimsically bequeathed its annual rent of 4<i>l.</i> to be
  appropriated in the manner above mentioned."</p>

  <p><i>The Orkneys in Pawn.</i>&mdash;Dr. Clarke mentions a curious

  pawn. Looking over some old deeds and records, belonging to the Danish
  crown, at Copenhagen, Mr. Auker found that these islands were consigned
  to England, in lieu of a dowry for a Danish princess, married to one of
  our English kings, upon condition that these islands should be restored
  to Denmark whenever the debt for which they were pledged should be
  discharged. Therefore, as the price of land, and the value of money, have
  undergone such considerable alteration since this period, it is in the
  power of Denmark, for a very small sum, to claim possession of the
  Orkneys.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THE METEORIC STONE OF THE THRACIAN CHERSONESUS.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> just published, the reviewer, in the
  course of an interesting article on "Meteors, Aerolites, and Shooting
  Stars," makes a suggestion which, if admitted into "N. &amp; Q.," may
  <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>meet the eye of some English resident or
  traveller in the East, who will give to it the attention it deserves.</p>

  <p>A great degree of interest is attached to the recorded fall of
  aerolites in times past, and the most remarkable and authentic record of
  antiquity on this subject is that of the massive stone which fell in the
  78th Olympiad (about the time of the birth of Socrates), at Ægospotamos
  (the goat's river), on the Hellespont,&mdash;the place soon afterwards
  the scene of that naval victory of Lysander, in the last year of the
  Peloponnesian war, which subjected Athens and Greece for a time to the
  Spartan power. The fall of this stone, says the reviewer, is expressly
  mentioned by Aristotle; by the author of the Parian Chronicle; by
  Diogenes of Apollonia; and most fully by Plutarch and Pliny, both of whom
  distinctly state it to be shown in their time&mdash;the sixth century
  after its fall. Pliny's description is well marked. "Qui lapis etiam nunc
  ostenditur, magnitudine vehis, colore adusto;" and he adds the fact that
  a burning comet (meteor) accompanied its descent. Plutarch explicitly
  states that it was still held in much veneration by the inhabitants of
  the Chersonesus. He also speaks of its vast size. If the mass remained
  visible, and of such magnitude as described, down to Pliny's time, it is
  far from impossible (remarks the reviewer) that it may even now be
  re-discovered, with the aid, perchance, of some stray tradition attached
  to the place, surviving, as often happens, the lapse of ages, the changes
  of human dominion, and even the change of race itself, upon the spot. The
  locality, indeed, is not further indicated than by the statement of its
  fall at Ægospotamos; but the invariable manner in which it is thus
  described defines tolerably well the district to be examined. We learn
  (he adds) from the old geographers, that there was a town called
  Ægospotami on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, and we may infer a
  stream from which its name was derived. The description of the naval
  fight, and the situation relatively to Lampsacus (the modern Lamsaki),
  further define the locality within certain limits. The reviewer then adds
  some practical suggestions of importance. The traveller devoting himself
  to this research should make his head-quarters at various places near the
  spot in question. He should render himself previously familiar with the
  aspect of meteoric stones, as now seen in European cabinets, and should
  study the character of rocks and fragmentary masses in the vicinity, to
  appreciate the differences of aspect. A small part only of the mass may
  now appear above the surface, and may even be wholly concealed by
  alluvial deposits, in which case the research would, of course, be in
  vain, unless happily aided by local tradition, which at the outset should
  be sedulously sought for. The research, if successful, would be of
  interest enough, both for history and science, to perpetuate a man's
  name. In the hope that some of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q.," now
  sojourning in, or likely to visit the locality, may be tempted to
  undertake it, I send you these suggestions, extracted from an article of
  no small scientific interest and value; and I will conclude with the
  Query, whether the "sacred black stone," which is mentioned by Colonel
  Williams (the British Commissioner for the settlement of the Turkish
  boundary question) to be regarded by the Seids inhabiting Despool as
  their palladium, has any legend of meteoric origin connected with its
  history?</p>

<h3>BANBURY CAKES AND ZEAL.</h3>

  <p><i>The Tatler</i>, No. 220., in describing his "Ecclesiastical
  Thermometer" which gave indication of the changes and revolutions in the
  Church, and of the different degrees of heat in religion throughout the
  country, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To complete the experiment, I prevailed upon a friend of mine, who
  works under me in the occult sciences, to make a progress with my glass
  through the whole island of Great Britain; and after his return, to
  present me with a register of his observations. I guessed beforehand at
  the temper of several places be passed through by the characters they
  have had time out of mind. Thus that facetious divine, Dr. Fuller,
  speaking of the town of Banbury near a hundred years ago, tells us, it
  was a place famous for cakes and zeal, which I find by my glass is true
  to this day as to the latter part of this description; though I must
  confess it is not in the same reputation for cakes that it was in the
  time of that learned author."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Gough's <i>Camden</i>, vol. i. p. 298., there is rather an amusing
  account of the manner in which the town of Banbury gained a proverbial
  reputation for zeal; and the following note by Mr. Camden, in his MS.
  supplement to the <i>Britannia</i>, is added:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Put out the word <i>zeale</i> in Banbury, where some think it a
  disgrace, when as <i>zeale</i> with knowledge is the greater grace among
  good Christians; for it was first foysted in by some compositor or
  pressman, neither is it in my Latin copie, which I desire the reader to
  hold as authentic."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Ray gives as a proverbial saying:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Banbury veal, cheese, and cakes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and refers to the mistake in Camden.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Now it is <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>possible, that Dr.
  Fuller derived his estimation of the town of Banbury from Camden; still,
  as we know that Banbury in the seventeenth century had a character for
  Puritanism, he may have intended by the word <i>zeal</i> to refer to the
  sectarian spirit of the inhabitants. But what I would ask is, whether any
  events occurred in Banbury in the eighteenth century, which justify
  <i>The Tatler</i> in classing it among those places which were hot in the
  cause of the Church; and giving to the words of the "facetious divine,"
  whom he quotes, a signification entirely different to that which must
  have been intended?</p>

  <p>Also, where is the first mention of Banbury cakes? Did their
  reputation decline in the eighteenth century, and revive again
  afterwards; or had they a celebrity in early days to which the present
  age can present no parallel? The Banbury people would hardly assent to
  <i>The Tatler's</i> disparaging remark.</p>

  <p><i>Richardson or Murphy.</i>&mdash;I have in my collection a portrait,
  purporting to be that of "Joseph Richardson, Esq., Barrister, and Member
  for Newport in Cornwall," engraved in line by W. J. Newton, from a
  picture by the late president, M. A. Shee, Esq., R.A.; and another
  impression, from the <i>same</i> plate, inscribed "James Murphy, Esq.,

  cannot be broken "even by the white man, clever as he is." Mr. Walpole
  certainly failed in his attempts to clear a way through it. Will any of

  governments, it is to be hoped that it may be finally settled.</p>

  <p>In June, 1623, a vessel arrived at Plymouth, Cape Cod, commanded by
  Admiral West, who had been sent from England for the sole purpose of
  preventing all persons, whether subjects of Great Britain or foreigners,
  from fishing on the coast, unless they had previously obtained permission
  for that purpose from the Council of New England. The admiral meeting
  with much opposition, and finding he could not settle the question in an
  amicable manner, left Plymouth in disgust, and sailed for southern
  Virginia. The colonists then appealed to Parliament, and an act was
  passed that the fisheries <i>should be free</i>.</p>

  called "The Grindle," close adjoining the town of Bury St. Edmund's; and
  consists of an encampment and earthworks, very similar to several
  mentioned before in "N. &amp; Q." under the articles "Grimsdyke" (Vol.
  iv., pp. 152. 331. 454.; Vol. v., p. 43. &amp;c.). A local guide to the
  town (Gillingwater, p. 5.) gives the word <i>Grim</i>, a
  fortress=<i>Grinneal</i>, depths in the ground.</p>

  the word, or of its origin at Bury?</p>

  them; and near by some camels are grazing. In another part is seen a
  cluster of trees, and seated in the branches of the first and largest

<h3>MRS. MACKEY'S POEMS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 578.)</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mary Mackey was "a real person," and the widow of a conveyancer
  in good practice. Of him she says (<i>Scraps of Nature</i>, p. 362.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The husband of poor Nature was a gentleman and an honest man, made a
  fortune and spent it nearly, in which his wife had no share, for that he
  governed and ruled the roast is well known to many: he had a noble and
  generous soul, but always kept poor Nature's talents under a bushel,
  where they shall never go again. He was old enough to be her father, and
  ever treated her like a child."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He left only enough to purchase for her a small annuity. She was
  uneducated, as she says, p. 274.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I never learned to write or spell,</p>
      <p>Although I read and write so well;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>but laboured under the illusion that she was a poetess. She sought an
  interview with Hewson Clarke by inviting him to meet a lady who admired
  his writings in White Conduit Fields. He went, and was somewhat mortified
  to find a matron of about forty-five, who placed her MS. in his hand, and
  requested his candid opinion on a future day. She was lady-like and
  sensible upon all matters except her own poems. Of course his opinion was
  easily formed; but he assured her that, though the poems were very good,
  they would not suit the public taste, and that she would be rash in
  publishing. She took his advice, but unfortunately happened to know Peter
  Pindar, who had been one of her husband's friends. She devotes a "scrap"
  to a kiss which he gave her (p. 215.). He was blind, but on hearing some
  of her poems read, he exclaimed, "Oh, my God, madam, there is nothing
  like this in Shakspeare!" Such a compliment turned her head; she sold her
  annuity to publish her book, and was reduced to extreme distress and
  misery. This is stated in a notice of the book in <i>The British
  Stage</i>, Sept. 1817, p. 210. The article, which is signed K., was
  written by the editor, Mr. Jones Broughton of the India House, a friend
  of Hewson Clarke, and once editor of <i>The Theatrical
  Inquisitor</i>.</p>

  <p>I agree with G. C. that the "scraps" are <i>niaiseries</i>; as
  literature nothing can be worse; but they are curious and, I think,
  deeply interesting as genuine expressions of feeling. Mary Mackey was
  vain and weak, but true-hearted, <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>generous, and
  affectionate; she conceals nothing, and lays bare her poverty and her
  wish to marry again. She advertises herself under the form of a pony for
  sale:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For since she has been free by the death of her</p>
      <p>Late owner, the poor thing has been a scamperer,</p>
      <p><i>And has often known the want of a good meal;</i></p>
      <p><i>For she was highly fed in her old master's lifetime.</i></p>
      <p>But he, alas! sleeps in peace, and peace be to his soul.</p>
      <p>He was a good master and a real gentleman,</p>
      <p>And left his little trotter to a merciless world:</p>
      <p>She is gentle by Nature; <i>but the poor thing's heart</i></p>
      <p><i>Is now breaking</i>; yet by kind treatment she might</p>
      <p>Be made one of the most valuable and amusing</p>
      <p>Things in Nature. She is a little foundered, but not to hurt</p>
      <p>Or retard her movements; she is of some mettle and</p>
      <p>High spirit, notwithstanding her hard fate,</p>
      <p>She will even kick if roughly handled,</p>
      <p>Nor would she suffer a dirty hand to touch her."&mdash;P. 105.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Again, she says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I wish I had an only friend,</p>
      <p class="i1">To shield me from the winter's blast,</p>
      <p>For should I live to see another,</p>
      <p class="i1">He may cut keener than the last;</p>
      <p>And I shall never wish to feel</p>
      <p class="i1">A keener winter than the past."&mdash;P. 288.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>She complains of a refusal from one to whom she wrote "to beg or
  solicit some bacon," and says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To him she has given, <i>she never did lend</i>,</p>
      <p>For her plan is to give to the foe or the friend."&mdash;P. 180.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some one, probably Clarke, wrote an anonymous letter to dissuade her
  from publishing. This she answers indignantly in prose, concluding:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Should he be tempted to write again, let him sign his name, or where
  a letter may find the kind-hearted creature, who has such a love for
  Nature. His stinging advice was to run down the widow's soul's delight,
  her dear scraps, which not a block in Nature can suppress"&mdash;P.
  366.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Throughout the silliness run veins of feeling, respect for her
  husband, gratitude for the smallest acts of kindness, and cheerfulness
  under want. In some lines to a cat, apparently written during her
  husband's sickness, she says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now Grimalkin each day on her throne takes a seat,</p>
      <p>With a smile on her face when her master can eat;</p>
      <p><i>But, alas! he eats little.</i>"&mdash;P. 309.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Truly Mary Mackey must have been a good wife and friend, and I hope I
  may claim some credit for extracting evidence thereof from perhaps the
  weakest verses ever written. Her own opinion was different, and is thus
  expressed in her</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Preface or no Preface.</span>&mdash;No preface can
  be to the Scraps of Nature, for God gave none when He formed creation,
  nor was there ever a book sent into the world like the volume of Nature,
  since the creation of the world, nor ever so bold an undertaking. It has
  never been seen by any eye, nor corrected by any hand, but the eye and
  hand of the writer. No volume has more humour," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>G. C.'s copy is defective. Mine has a portrait of Mrs. Mary Mackey,
  which indicates considerable beauty, despite of very poor drawing and
  engraving, and the execrable thin curls and short waist of 1809. The
  "falling tear is visible;" but, had not the authoress told us what it
  was, it might be taken for a mole or a wart. As the face is perfectly
  cheerful, and the "scrap" is headed "Compliment to the Engraver," I
  hazard the conjecture that he was instructed to add the tear to a
  miniature painted before she had been compelled to shed tears on her own
  account.</p>

<h3>MAP OF CEYLON.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 65.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Ajax</span> asks information of me
  as to the best, or even a tolerable, map of Ceylon. I am not surprised at
  the inquiry, as no satisfactory map of that island exists to my
  knowledge. It may illustrate this assertion to mention, that in 1849 I
  travelled through the vast and interesting district of Neura Kalawa, to
  the north of the Kandyan range; and I carried with me the map of "India
  and Ceylon," then published, and since reprinted in 1852, by the Society
  for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In that map the country I was
  passing through appears as a large blank, with the words "Unknown
  mountainous region." But I found it abounding in prosperous villages, and
  tracts of land cultivated both for rice and dry grain. So far from being
  "unknown," its forests have a numerous though scattered population; and
  as to its being "mountainous," there is scarcely a hill in the entire
  "region." There is a meagre map of Ceylon, drawn by George Atkinson, who
  was civil engineer and surveyor-general of the colony, and published by
  Wylde in 1836. It is more correct than others, but sadly deficient in
  information.</p>

  <p>Mr. Arrowsmith, of Soho Square, published in 1845 an admirable map of
  what is called the Kandy Zone, being the central province of the island,
  prepared by the Deputy Quarter-Master-General, Colonel Frazer; assisted
  by Captain Gallwey and Major Skinner, of the Ceylon Civil Service. Col.
  Frazer has since placed in Mr. Arrowsmith's hands a map of the entire
  island: it has not yet appeared; but when published it will be found to
  be as nearly perfect in its details as any map can be.</p>

  <p>In reply to the inquiry of <span class="sc">Ajax</span> as to the
  publication of my own work on the history and <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>topography of Ceylon,
  it is still in hand; but the pressure of official and parliamentary
  duties has sadly retarded its preparation for the press.</p>

<h3>"AM, HAVE, AND WILL BE:" HENRY VIII., ACT III. SC. 2.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p.5.)</p>

  <p>Independently of the obvious probability that Shakspeare, in these
  three words, intended to embody the present, the past, and the future,
  there is another reason why we can by no means part with <i>have</i>, or
  suffer it to be changed into any other word; and that is, because it is
  open to one of those parallel analogies which I have so often upheld as
  sure guides to the true reading. Only a few lines before, in a previous
  speech of Wolsey's, he makes use of a precisely similar elliptical
  coupling together of the verbs <i>have</i> and <i>be</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12hg3">"My loyalty,</p>
      <p>Which ever <i>has</i>, and ever <i>shall be</i>, growing."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have, in "has and shall be," the identical combination which,
  in the case of "have and will be," has given rise to so much doubt; so
  that we have only to understand the one phrase as we do the other, and
  make the slight addition of the personal pronoun I (not before, but after
  <i>am</i>), to render Wolsey's exclamation not only intelligible, but
  full of emphasis and meaning.</p>

  <p>But in the first place the King's speech to Wolsey might be more
  intelligibly pointed if the words "your bond of duty" were made a
  parenthetical explanation of <i>that</i>. The "bond of duty" is the mere
  matter-of-course duty to be expected from every subject; but the King
  says that, over and above <i>that</i>, Wolsey ought, "as 'twere in loves
  particular," to be <i>more</i>! Thereupon Wolsey exclaims&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12hg3">"I do profess</p>
      <p>That for your highness' good I ever labour'd</p>
      <p>More than mine own."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here he pauses, and then immediately continues his protestation in the
  fine passage, the meaning of which has been so much disputed; suddenly
  reverting to what the King had just said he <i>ought</i> to be, he
  exclaims:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"<i>That</i>, am I, have, and will be,</p>
      <p>Though all the world should crack their duty to you,</p>
      <p>and throw it from their soul," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Still less can it be permitted to change "crack their duty" into "lack
  their duty." Setting aside all consideration of the comparative force of
  the two words, and the circumstance that <i>crack</i> is frequently used
  by Shakspeare in the sense of <i>sever by violence</i>&mdash;the adoption
  of <i>lack</i> would be to attribute to Shakspeare an absolute blunder,
  for how could "all the world" <i>throw from their soul</i> that which
  they <i>lacked</i>?</p>

  <p>With reference to another alteration ("capable" into "palpable," in
  <i>As You Like It</i>, Act III. Sc. 5.), notwithstanding that it seems so
  obvious, and has been declared so self-evident, "<i>as to be lauded needs
  but to be seen</i>," I, for one, enter my protest against it, being of
  opinion that the conservation of <i>capable</i> is absolutely essential
  to the context.</p>

  <p><i>Capable</i> may be, and has been, defended upon various grounds;
  but there is one consideration which, with me, is all-sufficient, viz.,
  it is necessary for the explanation and defence of the accompanying word
  "<i>cicatrice</i>." <i>Capable</i> is <i>concave</i>, and has reference
  to the <i>lipped</i> shape of the impression, and <i>cicatrice</i> is a
  <i>lipped</i> scar; therefore one word supports and explains the other.
  And it is not a little singular that <i>cicatrice</i> should, in its
  turn, have been condemned as an improper expression by the very critic
  (Dr. Johnson) who, without perceiving this very cogent reason for so
  doing, nevertheless explains "capable impressure" as <i>a hollow
  mark</i>.</p>

<h3>SIR HENRY WOTTON'S LETTER TO MILTON.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 5.; Vol. vii., p. 7.)</p>

  <p>I desire to speak with the greatest deference to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Bolton Corney's</span> superior judgment, but still I cannot help saying
  that Thomas Warton's remarks upon "our common friend Mr. R." and "the
  late R.'s poems" do not seem to be supported by the facts. Randolph's
  poems were printed at Oxford in 1638, but in which month we are not told.
  The first question then is this, Were they printed before or after the
  13th of April, when Wotton's letter was written? If <i>after</i> the
  13th, or even the 6th of April, when Milton's presentation copy of
  <i>Comus</i> was forwarded, of course the matter is decided. But,
  allowing for the present that they were printed <i>before</i> the 13th of
  April in the year 1638, I must ask, in the second place, Could Sir H.
  Wotton predicate of any volume printed in that year before that date (or
  rather of <i>Comus</i> stitched up with that volume), that he had viewed
  it <i>some long time before</i> with singular delight? I certainly think
  not, but shall be very happy to have my objections overruled.</p>

  <p>Then, again, if we admit <span class="sc">Mr. Bolton Corney's</span>
  "novel conjecture" (which I freely allow to be a great improvement upon
  that of Thomas Warton), how comes it the Sir H. Wotton knew nothing of
  "the true artificer" of <i>Comus</i> until he was let into the secret by
  Milton himself? If Robert Randolph was the "common friend" of Wotton and
  Milton, was he not likely to have <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>known something of the
  authorship of <i>Comus</i>, and to have enlightened Sir Henry thereon? My
  principal objection remains. Thomas Randolph was far too popular a poet
  to have been contemptuously alluded to by Wotton or any one else in that
  age, and, making all due allowance for laudation and compliment, Wotton
  does disparage the poems to which Milton's <i>Masque</i> was
  appended.</p>

  <p>I think that quaint old Winstanley gives the general opinion of
  Randolph. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was one of such a pregnant wit that the Muses may seem not only to
  have smiled, but to have been tickled at his nativity, such the festivity
  of his poems of all sorts."&mdash;<i>Lives of English Poets</i>, p. 142.,
  Lond. 1687.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We must therefore, perhaps, look out for some more obscure and
  worthless poet, whose "principal" Milton's "accessory" was to "help
  out."</p>

  <p>When writing on this subject before, I said that Samuel Hartlib had
  not settled in England at the time of Sir H. Wotton's letter to Milton
  (Vol. vi., p. 5.). I am indebted to Warton for that mistake. He fixes the
  date of his coming hither to "about the year 1640." (<i>Illustrations of
  Milton's Minor Poems</i>, p. 596.: Lond. 1775.)</p>

  <p>Samuel Hartlib figures amongst the correspondents of Joseph Mede in
  March, 1634, and even then dated from London. (Mede's <i>Works</i>, vol.
  ii. lib. iv. p. 1058.: Lond. 1664, fol.)</p>

  <p>Amongst the <i>Letters and Despatches</i> of Lord Strafforde are two
  letters from Sir Henry Wotton, which do not appear in the <i>Reliquiæ</i>
  (vide vol. i. pp. 45-48.: Dublin, 1740, fol.), though some sentences in
  the former of the two may be found at p. 373. of said work. I often find
  it a pleasant employment to fill up the gaps and trace out the allusions
  in Wotton's correspondence.</p>

  <p>May I give a short specimen of one of his letters filled up? It was
  written, I suppose, to Nicholas Pey:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My dear Nic,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"More than a voluntary motion doth now carry me towards Suffolk,
  especially that I may confer by the way with an excellent physician at
  B., whom I brought myself from Venice."&mdash;<i>Reliquiæ</i>, p.
  359.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By "B." is meant St. Edmund's Bury, and by the "excellent physician"
  no less than <i>Gaspero Despotine</i>, who, together with Mark Anthony de
  Dominis, accompanied Sir H. Wotton and his chaplain Bedell from
  Italy.</p>

  <p>However, he was very unlike the archbishop of whom Dr. Crakanthorp
  used to say, that he was well called "De Dominis in the plural, for he
  could serve two masters, or twenty if they would all pay him wages."
  (Hacket's <i>Life of Williams</i>, part i. p. 103.: Lond. 1693, fol.)
  Despotine left Italy that he might at the same time leave the communion
  of the Church of Rome, and when Bedell was appointed to the living of St.
  Edmund's Bury, he accompanied him thither. One of Wotton's very
  interesting letters announces the event. (<i>Reliquiæ</i>, p. 400.) Under
  the fostering care of the saintly Bedell, Despotine rose to eminence in
  his profession at St. Edmund's Bury, and kept up a kind correspondence
  with his guide and patron after his promotion to the Provostship of
  Trinity College, Dublin, and the sees of Ardagh and Kilmore. (Burnet's
  <i>Life of Bishop Bedell</i>, ad init.)</p>

  <p>In another letter (<i>Reliquiæ</i>, p. 356.) Wotton speaks of having
  given also to Michael Brainthwaite and the young Lord Scudamore the
  advice of Alberto Scipioni to himself, to "keep his eyes open and his
  mouth shut," which Milton sadly disregarded.</p>

<h3>SKULL-CAPS VERSUS SKULL-CUPS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 441. 565.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">James Graves</span> seems to
  consider cooking in a skull impossible. I certainly have never tried it,
  nor do I wish to express an opinion as to the taste of the Irish or their
  invaders, <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1315, though methinks those who
  relished the "flesh" need not have demurred to the pot. But as to the
  possibility, in Ewbank on <i>Hydraulic Machines</i>, book i. cap. 3., I
  find the following mention of</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Primitive Boilers.</span>&mdash;The gourd is
  probably the original vessel for heating water, &amp;c. &amp;c., its
  exterior being kept moistened by water while on the fire, as still
  practised by some people, while others apply a coating of clay to protect
  it from the effects of flame."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He then quotes Kotzebue as finding "the Radack Islanders boiling
  something in cocoa-shells." A primitive Sumatran vessel for boiling rice
  is the bamboo, which is still used; by the time the rice is dressed the
  vessel is nearly destroyed by the fire. This destructibility needs hardly
  to be considered an objection to the "starving fugitives," as plenty of
  the same kind must have been at hand, and even an Irishman's skull is
  probably as little inflammable as gourds, cocoa-sells, or bamboos.</p>

  arsenic.</p>

<h3>INEDITED POEM BY POPE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 57.)</p>

  <p>This, which is headed "Note," ought to have been headed <i>Query</i>:
  and it affords an instance of ignorance on the part of some of our
  correspondents; and of, I fear I must add, inattention on that of our
  worthy Editor, which I think it right to notice as a warning to all
  parties for the future: and I appeal to the candour of our Editor himself
  to give my protest a place.</p>

  <p>The first step in this curious affair is to be found in "N. &amp; Q.,"
  Vol. ii., p. 7., where "<i>the Editor of Bishop Warburton's Literary
  Remains</i>" produced, as attributed to Mr. Charles Yorke, a kind of
  epitaph of sixteen lines, beginning&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Stript to the naked soul, escaped from clay."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That the "editor of Bishop Warburton's <i>Literary Remains</i>," and
  his friend "an eminent critic," should have been at a loss to know where
  these well-known verses were to be found, and should have countenanced
  their having been Charles Yorke's, seems the more wonderful: for the
  verses are given in <i>Warburton's own letters</i> as <i>Pope's</i>, and
  were printed near a hundred years ago in Ruffhead's <i>Life of Pope</i>,
  <i>as Pope's</i>; and in the MS. copy furnished by Mr. Yorke, they are
  marked as "Mr. Pope's."</p>

  <p>The next error is, that this mention of Mr. Yorke's name&mdash;though
  his MS. bore the name of <i>Pope</i>&mdash;seems to have given rise to
  the idea that <i>he</i> was the author, which Lord Campbell has so fully
  adopted as to have reprinted, in his <i>Lives of the Chancellors</i>
  (vol. v. p. 428.), the verses as the composition of <i>Charles
  Yorke</i>.</p>

  <p>We next find in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iii., p. 43., a reply of W. S. to
  the Query of Warburton's editor, stating "that the verses were by
  <i>Pope</i>," and <i>lately</i> republished in a miscellany by James
  Tayler, with a statement that they <i>were not inserted in any edition of
  Pope's works</i>. The fact being, that they have been inserted in
  Warton's edition, 1797; and in Bowles', and in all subsequent editions
  that I have seen: and it seems strange that W. S. did not take the
  trouble of verifying, by a reference to <i>any</i> edition of Pope, the
  statement that he quoted.</p>

  <p>Next we have, in the same (3rd) volume of "N. &amp; Q.," a
  communication from <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>, which states
  correctly all the foregoing circumstances, with the addition, that the
  verses appeared as <i>Aaron Hill's</i> in an edition of his works as
  early as 1753. Thence arises another discussion; were they Pope's or
  Hill's? Roscoe thought they were Hill's; <span class="sc">Mr.
  Crossley</span> thinks they were Pope's. I think, both from external and
  internal evidence, that they were not Pope's. But that has little to do
  with my present object, which is to show how often the matter has been
  already discussed in "N. &amp; Q." I must observe, however, that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span> has fallen into a slight anachronism. He
  says that the verses were "transferred from Ruffhead into <i>Bowles'</i>
  edition;" whereas they, as I have stated, were transferred into
  <i>Warton's</i> many years earlier.</p>

  <p>After all this disquisition comes a recent Number of "N. &amp; Q.," of
  which a <i>column and a quarter</i> is wasted by a correspondent A. T.
  W., who confesses that he (or she) has <i>not a modern edition of Pope
  within reach</i>, and begs to know whether these verses (repeated <i>in
  extenso</i>) "have been yet introduced to the public?"</p>

  <p>Surely "N. &amp; Q." should beware of correspondents that write to
  inquire about Pope, without having an edition of his works; and I cannot
  but wonder that this <i>crambe</i>, which had been served up thrice
  before, and so fully by <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>, should have
  been <i>recocta</i>, and introduced as a new theme, entitled to a special
  attention.</p>

<h3>CIBBER'S "LIVES OF THE POETS."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 161.)</p>

  <p>Allow me to draw your attention to a <i>curious letter</i> which I
  transcribe, with reference to the above. It appears to have escaped the
  notice of <span class="sc">Mr. Croker</span>, although it corroborates
  his statements. It was written by the bookseller himself who published
  the <i>Lives</i>, and would seem to set the matter as to their authorship
  completely at rest. Griffiths appears to have been also the editor of the
  <i>Monthly Review</i>; and Cartwright, the inventor of the power-loom, to
  whom the letter is addressed, to have been one of his contributors.</p>

  <p>"I have sent you a <i>feast</i>! Johnson's <i>new</i> volumes of the
  <i>Lives of the Poets</i>. You will observe that Savage's <i>Life</i> is
  one of the volumes. I suppose it is the same which he published about
  thirty years ago, and therefore you will not be obliged to notice it
  otherwise than in the course of enumeration. In the account of Hammond,
  my good friend Samuel has stumbled on a material circumstance in the
  publication of Cibber's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>. He intimates that
  Cibber never saw the work. This is a reflection on the bookseller, your
  humble servant. The bookseller <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>has now in his possession Theophilus
  Cibber's receipt for twenty guineas (Johnson says ten), in consideration
  of which he engaged to 'revise, correct, and improve the work, and also
  to affix his name in the title-page.' Mr. Cibber did accordingly very
  punctually revise every sheet; he made numerous corrections, and added
  many improvements: particularly in those lives which came down to his own
  times, and brought him within the circle of his own and his father's
  literary acquaintance, especially in the dramatic line. To the best of my
  recollection, he gave some entire lives, besides inserting abundance of
  paragraphs, of notes, anecdotes, and remarks, in those which were
  compiled by Shiells and other writers. I say <i>other</i>, because many
  of the best pieces of biography in that collection were not written by
  Shiells, but by superior hands. In short, the engagement of Cibber, or
  some other <i>Englishman</i>, to superintend what Shiells in particular
  should offer, was a measure absolutely necessary, not only to guard
  against his Scotticisms, and other defects of expression, but his
  virulent Jacobitism, which inclined him to abuse every Whig character
  that came in his way. This, indeed, he would have done; but Cibber (a
  stanch Williamite) opposed and prevented him, insomuch that a violent
  quarrel arose on the subject. By the way, it seems to me, that Shiell's
  Jacobitism has been the only circumstance that has procured him the
  regard of Mr. Johnson, and the favourable mention that he has made of
  Shiell's 'virtuous life and pious end'&mdash;expressions that must draw a
  smile from every one who knows, as I did, the real character of Robert
  Shiells. And now, what think you of noticing this matter in regard to
  truth, and the fair fame of the honest bookseller?"&mdash;<i>Memoir of

<h3>ENGLISH COMEDIANS IN THE NETHERLANDS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ii., pp. 184. 459.; Vol. iii., p. 21.)</p>

  <p>From the following extract from the <i>Thes. Rek.</i> (Treasury
  Accounts) of Utrecht, it appears that English actors performed there:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Schenkelwyn, 31 July, 1597. Sekere Engelsche Comedianten, voor hore

  wine.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the <i>Gerechtsdagboecken</i> (Minutes of the Council) of Leyden
  appear several requests of English comedians to perform there in 1614;
  these I hope soon to have in hand. I can now give the decision of the
  Council on the request of the Englishman W. Pedel:</p>

  diminished the taste for biblical and moral pieces. See Dr. Schotel,

<h3>LA BRUYÈRE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 38.)</p>

  <p>I am unable to reply to <span class="sc">Ursula's</span> questions;
  but I would ask permission to solicit from such of your better-informed
  correspondents as may become votaries to <span class="sc">Ursula</span>,
  that they would extend the range of their genealogical pilgrimage so far
  as to pay a visit to the ruins of Tor Abbey. I should be glad to learn
  whether either William Lord <i>Briewere</i> or William de la
  <i>Bruere</i> (both of whom were connected with the foundation of that
  religious house) were of the same family as Thibault de la
  <i>Bruyère</i>, the Crusader, who is one of the subjects of <span
  class="sc">Ursula's</span> inquiry. Dr. Oliver (<i>Monast. Exon.</i>,
  note at p. 179.) thinks that these two William Brewers may have
  represented families originally distinct from each other:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is some doubt," he says, "whether the family <i>De Brueriâ</i>
  or <i>Bruerâ</i>, which was settled in Devon at the time of the Domesday,
  and then held some of the lands afterwards given by W. <i>Briwere</i> to
  Torr Abbey, was the same as that of the founder. In this cartulary the
  two names are spelt differently, and Briwere seems <!-- Page 115 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>{115}</span>to have been a
  purchaser of De Bruerâ. See, upon this subject, Dugdale's
  <i>Baronage</i>, vol. i. p. 700., and Lysons' <i>Devonshire</i>, vol. i.
  p. 106. The names of Brieguerre and De Bruera existed contemporaneously
  in Normandy. See <i>Rot. Scacc. Norm. Indices</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Whether these two William Brewers represented distinct families or
  not, it appears that they became closely allied by marriage. At fol. 81.
  of an "Abstract of the Tor Cartulary, at Trinity College, Dublin," given
  by Oliver, p. 187., the following grants occur; viz.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Grant from William Briewere to William de la Brueriâ, of four
  librates of land in Wodeberi, with Engelesia his sister, <i>in liberum
  maritagium</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"Grant from said William de la Bruera, with the assent of Engelesia
  his wife, of all their land in Grendle to William Briewere, brother of
  the said Engelesia, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"Confirmation thereof by said Engelesia."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Both families appear to have given the name of <i>Brewer</i> to their
  places of residence.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The tything of <i>Teign Grace</i>," says Risdon, "anciently <i>Teign
  Brewer</i>, was in the time of King Henry the Second the land of Anthony
  de la Brewer, whom divers knights of that race succeeded. Sir William de
  la Brewer, the last of the male line, left this inheritance among
  co-heirs, Eva, wife of Thomas le <i>Grace</i>, and Isabel, &amp;c....
  Concerning which lands these lines I found in the leger-book of the Abbey
  of Torr: '<i>Galfridus de Breweria dominus de Teigne pro salut. animæ
  Will. de Breweria &amp; Argalesia uxor ejus conc. abbat. de Torr liberum
  transitum in Teigne.</i>'"&mdash;P. 135.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Buckland Brewer</i>, on the other hand, derived its name (according
  to the same authority) from the family of which William Lord Brewer was
  the representative.</p>

  <p>The Brewers appear to have founded other religious houses, and to have
  held possessions in other parts of England. It was from Welbeck Abbey, in
  Nottinghamshire, that William Lord Briwere obtained subjects for his
  abbey at Tor; and Bruern, or Temple Bruer, in Lincolnshire, belonging to
  the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, Clerkenwell (see Dugdale's
  <i>Monast.</i>, new edition, vol. vi. par. ii. p. 801.), would seem to
  owe its name to some connexion with the Brewer family, as did also,
  perhaps, Bruera in Chester, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Mention is made of a William de la Bruera in the <i>History of
  Northamptonshire</i> (edit. Oxon., 1791, tom. i. p. 233.), in connexion
  with the township of Grafton, to which manor Joane, his wife, and her
  sister Bruna, appear to have been co-heirs, as daughters of Ralph de S.
  Samson, temp. Henry III.</p>

  <p>William Brewer, Bishop of Exeter (<i>brother</i> of the William Lord
  Briewere already mentioned), was "put in trust" by King Henry III. "to
  conduct his sister, the Lady Isabella, into Germany, to her intended
  marriage with the Emperor Frederic." See Jenkins's <i>History of
  Exeter</i>, 1806, p. 252.</p>

  <p>"This Bishop Brewer also went into the Holy Land (<i>transfretavit,
  cruce signat.</i>) the eleventh of Henry the Third."&mdash;Risdon, edit.

</blockquote>

  <p>There was another William Brewer, a <i>son</i> of William Lord Brewer;
  but he died without male issue.</p>

  <p>I fear these few notices bear no very precise relation to <span
  class="sc">Ursula's</span> inquiries. Still I send them, in the hope of
  discovering, by the kindness of some of your erudite contributors, what
  is the difference (if any) between the names <i>La Bruyère</i>, <i>De la
  Bruere</i>, and <i>Briewere</i>; and also whether, <i>originally</i>,
  these names belonged to <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> distinct families, or
  only to so many different branches of the same family.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Sansom.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;The name <i>Bruere</i> is probably not yet extinct, either
  in France or in England. In the Bodleian Library there is a letter,
  addressed by <i>John Bruere</i> to the clergy of the diocese of Oxford,
  written within the last century, and bearing date "May 19, 1793,"
  "Odington, near Islip," of which place the author was probably the
  rector. And in the British Museum <i>Catalogue</i>, under the name of
  (<i>M. de la</i>) <i>Bruere</i>, is mentioned <i>Histoire du Règne de
  Charlemagne</i>, 2 tom. 12<sup>o</sup>; Paris, 1745.</p>

<h3>SOUTHEY'S CRITICISM UPON ST. MATHIAS' DAY IN LEAP-YEAR.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 58.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Yarrum's</span> <i>exposé</i> of Southey's
  singular blunder is perfectly just; but it does not include <i>the

  acquaintance with the distribution of Roman Catholic Feriæ.</p>

  <p>The allegation of error against the historians, because they had
  "fixed the appointed day on the eve of Mathias," would seem to imply that
  they might have fixed upon some other feast-day with more correctness;
  whereas there is no other in the calendar which could by any possibility
  be affected by leap-year: but the most extraordinary part of the mistake
  is, the ignorance it displays (scarcely credible in Southey) of the
  origin and etymology of the bissextile institution&mdash;the very subject
  he was criticising.</p>

  <p>Because the name "bissextile," as every body knows, arose from the
  repetition in leap-year of the identical day in question: the sixth of
  the kalends of March; the 24th of February; the feast of the Regifugium
  amongst the Romans; and of its substitute, that of St. Mathias, amongst
  the Christians.</p>

  <p>It is clear, that since the Regifugium was held upon the sixth day
  before the 1st of March (both inclusive), that day must, according to our
  <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>reckoning, be the 24th of February in
  common years, and the 25th in leap-years: therefore, the supernumerary or
  superfluous day, added on account of leap-year, was considered to be the
  24th of February, and not the 25th; which latter, in those years, became
  the true "Sixth before the Kalends." Indeed, it is highly probable,
  although it cannot be supported by direct evidence, that the first day of
  the double sextile was distinguished from its name-fellow of the
  following day by having the word "bis" prefixed to <i>sextum</i>; so
  that, in leap-years, the 24th of February would be expressed as follows:
  "Ante diem <i>bis</i><span class="nw">-VI</span> Calend. Martias;" while
  the following day, or the 25th of February (being considered the real
  Simon Pure), would retain the usual designation of "<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> VI Calend. Mar." Such an hypothesis offers a
  reasonable explanation of the seeming reversal in terms of calling the
  day which <i>first</i> arrived <i>posterior</i>, and that which succeeded
  it <i>prior</i>.</p>

  <p>Although the Church of England Calendar now places the feast of Saint
  Mathias invariably on the 24th of February in all years, yet the earlier
  copies of the Book of Common Prayer allocated it to "The Sixth of the
  Kalends of March," without any direction as to which of the two days,
  bearing that name in leap-years, it should be appropriated. The modern
  Reformed Church Calendar therefore repudiates the usage of the Romans
  themselves, rather than that of the Roman Catholics.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Portable Camera for Travellers.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent E. S.
  asks for a clear description of a camera that will supersede the
  necessity of a dark room. Mr. Stokes has invented one; and in the early
  part of the photographic exhibition at the Society of Arts it was
  exhibited. The weight of the camera is only nine pounds, including
  focussing-glass, lens, shutter, &amp;c. The shutter is so arranged that
  it will contain from twelve to twenty pieces of prepared paper, each
  piece between separate sheets of blotting-paper. Light and air are
  completely excluded, by the paper being pressed by the front portion of
  the shutter. When required for use, the first piece of paper is placed at
  the back of the glass. By the assistance of a small hood, the impression
  is then taken; and, by removing the millboard, the paper will fall back
  into its place. At the same time another piece can be brought forward,
  ready for a second picture, before focussing, and so on to the end. The
  hood is made of India rubber cloth, and answers the purpose of a
  focussing cloth, without the trouble of removing it from the camera
  throughout the day. The size of the pictures that can be taken by it is
  9½ by 12 inches. It has been tried during the latter part of the last
  year, and proved most successful.</p>

  <p><i>The Albumen Process.</i>&mdash;I shall be greatly obliged to <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, or any other photographer, by their kindly
  communicating through your medium their experience with albumenized
  glass. I have Thornthwaite's <i>Guide to Photography</i>.</p>

  <p>I should like answers to the following Queries:</p>

  <p>Must the albumen be poured off from the plate after it is spread over
  the surface, in the same manner as collodion?</p>

  <p>Is the plate (while roasting, according to the process of Messrs.
  Thompson and Ross) nearly perpendicular in the process?</p>

  <p>Will the iodized albumen, for giving the film, keep; and how long?</p>

  <p>How long will the plate retain its sensitiveness after exciting?</p>

  <p>May the same sensitive bath be used for a number of plates without
  renewing, in the same way as silver bath for collodion?</p>

  <p>In conclusion, what is the average time with single achromatic lens,
  six or seven inch focus, to allow to get a good picture?</p>

  <p>Will photographers who are chemists turn their attention to obtain
  sensitive dry glass plates? for I think there can scarcely be any doubt
  of the advantage of glass over paper for <i>small</i> pictures (weight,
  expense, &amp;c., are perhaps drawbacks for pictures larger than 5 × 4
  inches); but the desideratum is a sensitiveness nearly equal to
  collodion, and a plate that can be used dry.</p>

  <p><i>Black Tints of French Photographers.</i>&mdash;Can you inform me,
  through the medium of your valuable periodical, how those beautiful black
  tints, so much prized in the French prints from photographic negatives,
  are obtained? By so doing you will give great pleasure to several
  excellent amateur photographers, and especially your constant reader,</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Philophotog.</span></p>

  <p><i>Originator of the Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;As some think the
  credit of the invention of the collodion process a matter of dispute,
  will you allow me to remind your correspondents that the truth will be
  much easier to discover if they will confine themselves to actual
  facts?</p>

  <p>In No. 167., p. 47., G. C. first recklessly accuses <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> of untruth, and then tests his own claim to
  truth by quoting from Le Gray's edition of 1852, to prove Le Gray's
  edition of 1850. Why did he not go back at once to the 1850 edition; and
  if that contains anything like an intelligible process, why is it
  altogether omitted from Le Gray's edition of 1851, which was the one
  <span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> spoke of, and correctly? <!-- Page 117
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span></p>

  <p>The history of collodion is (as far as I know) this. In September,
  1850, <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> invited me to meet <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> at his house, and for the first time <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> produced some prepared collodion, a portion
  of which identical sample <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> now has in
  his possession.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Archer</span> had then been trying it some five
  or six weeks. His experiments then went on, and in March, 1851, he
  published it in the <i>Chemist</i>. Let any of your readers procure that
  Number, and compare <span class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> claim with Le
  Gray's, who, in 1852, states that he published it in 1850, and gave "the
  best method that has been discovered up to the present time;" and yet,
  singularly enough, in his edition of 1851, leaves out <i>this best
  method</i> entirely.</p>

  <p><i>Developing Paper Pictures with Pyrogallic Acid,
  &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Have any of your photographic correspondents tried
  developing their paper negatives with pyrogallic acid? If so, perhaps he
  would favour the readers of "N. &amp; Q." with the result of his
  experiments.</p>

  <p>In <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond's</span> process for paper negatives,
  he says the paper, after the iodizing solution has been applied, must be
  dried before soaking in water. I wish to ask whether it may be dried
  quickly by the fire, or must it be dried spontaneously by suspension,
  &amp;c.? Again, how long must the paper remain on the sensitive mixture:
  must it be placed on the sensitive solution, and <i>immediately</i> taken
  off and blotted, or placed on the sensitive solution, and <i>after some
  time</i> (what time?) taken off and <i>immediately</i> blotted?</p>

  <p>Have any of your readers substituted iodide of ammonium for iodide of
  potassium, in preparing paper, collodion, &amp;c., and with what success?
  And have they substituted nitrate of zinc for glacial acetic acid, as
  recommended in a French work, with any success?</p>

  <p><i>Waterloo</i> (Vol. vii., p. 82.).&mdash;P. C. S. S. conceives that
  it may be interesting to <span class="sc">Philobiblion</span> to learn
  that the greatest man in the world was not ignorant of the passage in
  Strada regarding <i>Waterloo</i>, to which <span
  class="sc">Philobiblion</span> refers. From a diary kept for some years,
  it appears that on Saturday, the 30th of October, 1843, P. C. S. S., who
  was then on a visit at Walmer Castle, had the pleasure of directing the
  Duke of Wellington's attention to the passage in question, as translated
  by Du Ryer (Paris, 1665). He well remembers that the Duke seemed to be
  greatly struck with it; that he more than once referred to it, in
  subsequent conversations; and that on the following day he requested P.
  C. S. S. to furnish him with a transcript, which he doubts not might
  still be found among the Duke's papers.</p>

  <p><i>Irish Peerages</i> (Vol. vi., p. 604.).&mdash;The book alluded to

  be the contemptible <i>Letters to George IV.</i>, by Captain Rock, a
  miserable attempt at a continuation of Moore's <i>Memoirs</i> of that
  mystic personage. Some half of the former book contains libellous notices
  of the "low origin" of the Irish nobility. Can your correspondent refer

  <p><i>Pepys's Morena</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 342. 373.).&mdash;In the note on
  this word in the last edition of the <i>Diary</i>, it is stated that it
  may be read either "Morma" or "Morena." There is little doubt but the
  latter is the correct reading. "Morena" is good Portuguese for a
  brunette, and may have been used by Pepys as a term of endearment for
  Miss Dickens, like the "Colleen dhas dhun" of the Irish, which has much
  the same meaning. The marriage of the king to Catherine of Braganza in
  the previous year would have caused her language to be more studied at
  this time, especially by persons about the court. Morma has no meaning
  whatever.</p>

  <p><i>Turner's View of Lambeth Palace</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 15.
  89.).&mdash;In reply to your correspondent L. E. X., respecting Mr.
  Turner's picture of Lambeth Palace (which is in <i>water-colours</i>), I
  beg leave to say that it is in the possession of a lady residing in
  Bristol, to whose father <i>it</i> was given by the artist after its
  exhibition at Somerset House, and it has never been in any other hands.
  The same lady has also a small portrait of Mr. Turner, done by
  <i>himself</i> when visiting her family about the year 1791 or 1792:
  further particulars respecting these pictures (if desired) may be known
  by a line addressed to Miss N&mdash;&mdash;, 8. St. James' Square,
  Bristol.</p>

  <p><i>Jennings Family</i> (Vol. vii., p. 95.).&mdash;I am much obliged to
  <span class="sc">Percuriosus</span> for his reply to my Query. The
  William Jennings, who was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1678, an admiral, and
  knighted by King James II. (see Le Neve's <i>Knights</i>, Harleian MS.
  5801.), was most probably descended from the Yorkshire family of that
  name, his escutcheon being the same. The Francis who married Elizabeth,
  daughter of Henry Spoure of Trebartha, was descended from the Shropshire
  family, whose arms were&mdash;Ermine, a lion rampant, gules quartered
  with those of Jay, as recorded in the Visitation by Henry, the son of
  Francis. This Francis died about 1610-11. His will (the executor being
  Henry Spoure) was proved at Doctors' Commons in 1611. But what I
  particularly wanted to ascertain was, whether Rowland, who is the first
  that occurs in the Cornish Visitation, was the first who settled in
  Cornwall. I have inquired at the Heralds' College, but can gain no
  further information than that to be found in the Visitations of Salop and
  Cornwall in the British Museum. <span class="sc">Percuriosus</span> would
  gratify my curiosity, if he would kindly inform me where the Spoure MSS.
  are to be seen. They are not to be found in the British Museum. I have
  always thought that they were in the hands of some member of the Rodd
  family, whose ancestor (a Life Guardsman) was about to be married to the
  heiress of all the Spoures, but she, dying before the marriage, left him
  all her estates, Trebartha among the rest which is in the possession of
  the family to this day.</p>

  in Central Germany it is a greenhouse plant.</p>

  <p><i>Mistletoe</i> (Vol. ii., p. 418.; Vol. iii., pp. 192. 226. 396.
  462.).&mdash;There is in the parish of Staveley, Derbyshire, a solitary
  mansion called the Hagg, erected by Sir Peter Frescheville, in what was
  at that time a park of considerable extent, for a hunting lodge, when age
  and infirmity prevented him from otherwise enjoying the pleasures of the
  chase. In one of Colepeper's MSS. at the British Museum, there is the
  following curious notice of this house:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is the Parke House which Sir Peter Frescheville, in his will,
  16th March, 1632, calls my new Lodge in Staveley Parke. Heare my Lord
  Frescheville did live, and heare growes <i>the famous mistleto tree, the
  only oake in England that bears mistleto</i>, which florished at my deare
  Wife's birth, who was born heare."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I presume it is the same which is referred to in the following letter
  addressed by the Countess of Danby to Mrs. Colepeper; it is without date,
  but was written between 1663 and 1682:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Dear Cosen.&mdash;Pray if you have any of the miselto of

  <p>The oak tree still exists, and in 1803 it contained mistletoe, but

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The issue by the Shakspeare Society of an edition of the <i>Notes and
  Emendations to the Text of Shakspeare's Plays from early MS. Corrections
  in a Copy of the Folio 1632, in the Possession of J. Payne Collier,
  Esq.</i>, affords an opportunity, of which we gladly avail ourselves, to
  recall attention to a volume which is unquestionably the most important
  contribution to Shakspearian literature which has issued from the press
  for many years. Although we have no evidence of the authority upon which
  these <i>Notes and Emendations</i> were made, an examination of them
  must, we think, convince even the most sceptical, that they were made
  upon <i>authority</i>, and are not the result of clever criticism and
  happy conjecture. The readers of "N. &amp; Q." know well what discussions
  have been raised upon such phrases as "Prenzie Angelo," "Whose mother was
  her painting," "Ribaudred nag," "Most busy, least when I do it," &amp;c.
  The writer of the <i>Notes and Emendations</i>, now first published, has
  given in these, and hundreds of other difficult and disputed passages,
  corrections which are consistent with Shakspeare's character as the poet
  of common sense. He converts the "<i>prenzie</i> Angelo" into the
  "priestly," and the "<i>prenzie guards</i>" into "<i>priestly garb</i>."
  So that the passage now reads&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"<i>Claud.</i> <span class="gap" style="width:3em;"></span>The priestly Angelo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1"><i>Isab.</i>  O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</p>
      <p>The damned'st body to invest and cover</p>
      <p>In priestly garb."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the passages to which we have referred above, "whose mother was her
  painting," is changed into "who smothers her with painting;" "ribraudred
  nag" into "ribald hag;" and the passage from <i>The Tempest</i> is made
  plain&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Most busy blest when I do it."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We think these examples are sufficient to make all lovers of
  Shakspeare anxious not only to examine the present volume, but to see the
  promised new edition of his works, in which Mr. Collier proposes to give
  the text as corrected by this great, although unknown authority.</p>

  <p>The meeting for the establishment of the Photographic Society, held on
  Thursday week at the Society of Arts, was most numerously attended. The
  Society was formed, Sir Charles Eastlake elected president for the first
  year, Mr. Fenton honorary secretary, and Mr. Roslyn treasurer. The
  subscription was fixed at one guinea, with an admission fee of the same
  amount.</p>

  <p>At a recent meeting of the <i>Surtees Society</i>, it was announced
  that the works in progress for this year are the <i>Pontifical of
  Egbert</i>, Archbishop of York (to be edited by the Rev. W. Greenwell),
  and a volume of <i>Wills and Inventories from the Registry at
  Richmond</i>, by Mr. Raine, Jun. The books for 1854 are to be the
  Northumbro-Saxon translation of <i>The Gospel of St. Matthew</i>, to be
  edited by the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, and the <i>Inventories and Account
  Rolls of the Monasteries of Monkwearmouth and Jarrow</i> until the
  Dissolution, which will appear under the editorship of the Rev. James
  Raine.</p>

  <p>The Corporation of London Library is being thrown open to all literary
  men; the tickets of admission being accompanied by letters expressive of
  a wish that the holders should make frequent use of them. This is an act
  of becoming liberality, worthy of imitation in other quarters.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>History of England
  from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles, 1713-1783</i>, by
  Lord Mahon, vol. i. This is the first volume of a new and revised edition
  of this history of a most important period in our national annals, by the
  noble President of the Society of Antiquaries.&mdash;<i>The Ethnology of
  the British Islands</i>, by R. G. Latham, M.D. The value of all Dr.
  Latham's researches, whether into the history of our language, or of the
  races by which these islands have been successively inhabited, is so
  fully recognised, that we may content ourselves by merely calling
  attention to the publication of this able little volume.&mdash;<i>On the
  Lessons in Proverbs: Five Lectures, &amp;c.</i>, by the Rev. R. C.
  Trench. Those who know the value of Mr. Trench's admirable lectures <i>On
  the Study of Words</i>, will find in this companion volume, in which he
  attempts to sound the depths and measure the real significance of
  National Proverbs, a book which will give them a pleasant hour's reading,
  and subjects for many pleasant hours' meditation.</p>

  Mediæval Symbols, and an Index of Emblems.</p>

  <p>"It is perhaps hardly necessary to observe, that this work is of an
  Archæological, and not a Theological character. The Editor has not
  considered it his business to examine into the truth or falsehood of the
  legends of which he narrates the substance; he gives them merely as
  legends, and, in general, so much of them only as is necessary to explain
  why particular emblems were used with a particular Saint, or why Churches
  in a given locality are named after this or that
  Saint."&mdash;<i>Preface.</i></p>

  <p>"The latter part of the book, on the early Christian and mediæval

  <p>MR. R. W. THOMAS begs most earnestly to caution photographers against
  purchasing impure chemicals, which are now too frequently sold at very
  low prices. It is to this cause nearly always that their labours are
  unattended with success.</p>

  <p>Chemicals of absolute purity, especially prepared for this art, may be
  obtained from R. W. THOMAS, Chemist and Professor of Photography, 10.
  Pall Mall.</p>

  <p>N.B.&mdash;The name of Mr. T.'s preparation, Xylo-Iodide of Silver, is
  made use of by unprincipled persons. To prevent imposition each bottle is

  never seen an introduction better calculated than the present to supply
  the wants of a beginner in a short space of time. The declensions and
  conjugations are well stated, and illustrated by references to the Greek,
  Latin, French, and other languages. A philosophical spirit pervades every
  part. The Delectus consists of short pieces on various subjects, with
  extracts from Anglo-Saxon History and the Saxon Chronicle. There is a
  good Glossary at the end."&mdash;<i>Athenæum</i>, Oct. 20, 1849.</p>
